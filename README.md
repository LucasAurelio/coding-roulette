# Coding Roulette

`The purpose of the Coding Roulette is to help me decide what project to work on.`

Sometimes is not easy to choose a different, personal project to dabble on after a whole day working. That's where the *coding roulette* comes in.

I am creating this lil' helper here for mainly two things:
* Keep me motivated to do a bit of coding every day
* Guide me through what to work on each of those days
